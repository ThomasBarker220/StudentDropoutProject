# University Students' Success and Dropout Rates Analysis
## README
This repository contains the code and data analysis for a research project focused on understanding the factors contributing to university students' success and dropout rates. The goal of this project is to identify key factors that can help educational institutions and policymakers implement strategies to reduce dropout rates and improve student outcomes.

### Data Sources
We used two separate data sources from Kaggle for this project:

- 'Predict students' dropout and academic success': This dataset contains demographic variables and outcomes (dropout, graduation, or still attending) for university students. The data was collected from a higher-level education institution.

- 'College Completion Rates and Efficiency Measures for US': This dataset contains information from the National Center for Education Statistics' Integrated Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS) and the Voluntary System of Accountability's Student Success and Progress Rate. We focused on the state_sector_grads dataset to analyze factors such as state, race, and graduation rate.

### Main Findings
Students who dropout generally have a higher median age at enrollment compared to those who graduate.
Private institutions have a higher mean graduation rate than public institutions.
Factors such as being male, not holding a scholarship, being in debt, not having tuition fees up to date, and being older positively contribute to a student's likelihood of dropping out.

### Future Work and Limitations
Further assessment and analysis of how race contributes to graduation and dropout rates.
Investigate the extent to which career interests contribute to graduation rates.
Explore alternative factors and further investigate the relationships between these factors and dropout rates.
Examine the effectiveness of intervention strategies based on the identified predictors.
